The code in this branch is a prototype of HotStuff using a PoA scheme as mempool and synchronizer. It supplements the paper [Using Proof of Availability for a Composable Blockchain Architecture ]() and there are no plans to maintain this branch. All data points used to produce the graphs of the paper are available in the folder [hotstuff/benchmark/data](benchmark/data/).
